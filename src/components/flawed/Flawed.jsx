            The SL55 is not perfect. Its ergonomics could be better, its
            rear-wheel steering system further improved, and the boot should be
            bigger. I am puzzled at the lack of soft-closing doors, and really,
            given the price tag, it's outrageous that carbon-ceramic brakes
            aren't standard.

          <p className="mb-5">
            The engine's heat also soaks into the cabin once it and the air-con
            are switched off. I excuse this by calling it the 'SL's warm
            embrace', but I am irked because the air-con can't seem to cool the
            cabin on a hot day.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            Exotic supercars aside, there are not many luxury cars today with
            the SL's heritage and V8 soundtrack. The last car I recall was the
            Lexus LC500 Convertible . But it doesn't feel as solid. It also does
            not have the SL's lineage.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            Attraction is a funny thing because it can both heighten and dull
            your senses. Seeing and driving the SL makes my pulse race, and at
            the same time, overlook its shortcomings.
          </p>
          <p>
            What matters most, though, is that driving it reminds me that life
            isn't just about work. And in it, I am also freed from
            sustainability's constant clamour. The SL refreshes my soul â€” how
            can I not love it so?
